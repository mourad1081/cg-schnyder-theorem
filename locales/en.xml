                Before digging further to the limbos of the Schynder's 
                theorem, one must first see some notions in order to 
                understand it clearly.

            <p>
                The first one is 
                <strong>the order</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An order is a notion which enable us to compare elements
                 of a set with each others. One define it as following:
            </p>
            <p>
                An order is a binary relation which is reflexive, antisymmetric 
                and transitive. Let \(E\) be a set. An internal relation 
                \( \leq \) on \( E \) is called an order relation if for
                 all elements \( x, y, z \in E \), we have :
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>\( x \leq x \), which is the reflexivity. 
                        An element is related, comparable to itself.</li>

                    <li>\( (x \leq y \wedge y \leq x) \Rightarrow x = y \), which is the antisymmetry. 
                        Two different elements cannot be related in two different directions, otherwise
                         they must be equal.</li>

                    <li>\( (x \leq y \wedge y \leq z) \Rightarrow x \leq z \), which is the transitivity. 
                        If an element is related to a second one and that second element is alo related with 
                        a third one, then the first and the third elements are related each other.</li>
                </ul>
