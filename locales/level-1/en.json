	"p1":"Before digging further to the limbos of the Schynder's theorem, one must first see some notions in order to understand it clearly.",
	"p2":"The first one is <strong>the order</strong>.",
	"p3":"An order is a notion which enable us to compare elements of a set with each others. One define it as following:",
	"p4":"An order is a binary relation which is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. Let \\(E\\) be a set. An internal relation \\( \\leq \\) on \\( E \\) is called an order relation if for all elements \\( x, y, z \\in E \\), we have :",
	"li1":"\\( x \\leq x \\), which is the reflexivity. An element is related, comparable to itself.",
	"li2":"\\( (x \\leq y \\wedge y \\leq x) \\Rightarrow x = y \\), which is the antisymmetry. Two different elements cannot be related in two different directions, otherwise they must be equal.",
	"li3":"\\( (x \\leq y \\wedge y \\leq z) \\Rightarrow x \\leq z \\), which is the transitivity. If an element is related to a second one and that second element is alo related with a third one, then the first and the third elements are related each other."
